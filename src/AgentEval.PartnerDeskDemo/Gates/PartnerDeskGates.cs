/// <para><b>Level 1 — intended use, at the tool seam.</b> Two rules, both deterministic, both microseconds:
/// <c>send_email</c> may only address the firm's own domain (a shipped <c>recipientDomainAllowList</c> contract
/// predicate), and <c>query_partner_database</c> must name one partner and stay inside a small row bound
/// (<see cref="PartnerRegisterScopeGate"/> — see that type for why it is not a contract predicate). The agent is
/// still persuaded on every run; it simply gains no authority from being persuaded.</para>
/// <para><b>Level 2 — stop the poison arriving, then isolate the source.</b> A tool-<i>result</i> admission gate
/// inspects what PartnerIntel returns before it enters model context, and a containment record for the
/// PartnerIntel MCP server makes the next call to it fail at admission. Level 1 stays installed underneath:
/// detection never retires authorization.</para>
/// <para><b>What is deliberately absent.</b> No LLM-backed <see cref="IToolGate"/> — Gatekeeper rejects those by
/// design, because tool middleware is the latency-sensitive effect boundary. No inline Tribunal judge: the shipped
/// indirect-injection axis is the semantically strongest answer to this attack and it stays shadow-only until it
/// clears a task-specific calibration bar, so this demo blocks with the deterministic prefilter and says so.</para>
